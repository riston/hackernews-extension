She wrote out little notes about what she was thankful for, prayers, practical messages (she had Type 1 diabetes, and told folks her insulin doses), and recipes this way. Eventually she had to switch to giving messages to a human holding a letter board by looking towards them for &#x27;yes&#x27; and away for &#x27;no&#x27;--cameras or Hawking&#x27;s infrared-laser-based system weren&#x27;t really feasible.<p>We looked at some software called EZ Keys from a company called Words Plus. (I don&#x27;t think she used it specifically, at least for long--I know she used another program, a DOS-based one called Living Better that ran in 40-col. mode that I can&#x27;t anything about on the Internet.) EZ keys looked more or less like Intel&#x27;s thing -- scan rows, scan items in a row, completions&#x2F;predictions over at left. It even had an option to use a frequency-sorted keyboard like the Intel one, with the common letters pushed to the top left (since those are the first rows&#x2F;cols to be scanned). Hawking apparently used EZ Keys, so it&#x27;s possible the Intel folks intentionally gave their thing a similar interface to make the transition easy.<p>It is worth remembering that no user cares if it&#x27;s WinForms or whatever. Some folks might like a nicer voice if they haven&#x27;t gotten used to theirs like Hawking ;), but the main concern is just getting the message across. Intel seems to have worked on the right stuff: better prediction (Presage <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;presage.sourceforge.net&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;presage.sourceforge.net&#x2F;</a>, which looks interesting) and context-sensitive controls. The infrared-laser-based input method sounds cool, too.<p>This is a neat space: an optimization&#x2F;prediction problem where improvements can be a significant help to someone. (There are also practical optimizations that don&#x27;t have much to do with the general word-prediction problem: sometimes people have to say things about their care, food, etc., or generic &#x27;hi&#x27; and &#x27;bye&#x27;, and it&#x27;s good if those are fast.) A Web page or Chrome extension can do a lot--how close can you get to smoothly operating the Web with just the spacebar? the arrow keys and Enter? or plain old typing, but slowed down and using 0-9 for completions?<p>I&#x27;ve heard that nowadays, people with communication trouble and enough movement use text-to-speech on mobile gadgets with their nifty and highly refined predictive input and that&#x27;s awesome.","time":1439831411,"type":"comment"},"10075086":{"by":"acqq","id":10075086,"kids":[10075418,10075730],"parent":10072188,"text":"Is there Hawking&#x27;s speech synthesis at all (there was an article that his voice is based on some hardware device <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wired.com&#x2F;2015&#x2F;01&#x2F;intel-gave-stephen-hawking-voice&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wired.com&#x2F;2015&#x2F;01&#x2F;intel-gave-stephen-hawking-voic...</a> )?
